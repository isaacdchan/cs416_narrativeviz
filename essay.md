# Messaging
The message I am trying to communicate is that the nutrition breakdown of the world's most popular grains does not differ by much. Leading one to coonclude that the popularity of a given grain is dependent on other factors

If it was within the scope of the project and I had the time, I would have broken down the cost to produce a given grain, the flexibility + uses (fuel, clothing, drink, types of food), and climates best suited to grow each grain to explain the popularity of each one

# Narrative Structure
The structure I used was an "interactive slide". The user begins at the main landing page which is a bar chart showing the popularity of each grain. The user can then drill down into each grain's nutrition breakdown by clicking on their respective bar

At each grain's page, the user then has the option to "Go Home" by clicking a button

# Visual Structure
The visual structure of the landing page scene is a **bar chart**. The grain's weight in metric tonnes is in descending order and the name is clearly labeled

If you hover over each grain's bar, it will highlight indicating the user that it is interactive

Each grain's scene uses the **pie chart** visual structure to convey the proportions of each nutrient. The color of each nutrient remains consistent across grains allowing for easy comparisons

# Scenes
There are 5 scenes in my visualization. One for the landing page, and one for each grain. The scenes are ordered in a root + leaf structure. You start at the root, and can descend to each grain leaf. But then have to ascend to the root before you can descend to another grain leaf

# Annotations
The annotation template I followed is simple captions underneath each grain's pie chart to reveal some comparative information. The annotations are static and do not change within a scene

# Parameters
There are not parameters within a scene but each of the 4 grains act as a parameter allowing the user to to set the state/scene/pie chart they want to view

# Triggers
The triggers in the home screen are the highlighting of each bar when you hover over them. This communicates to the user that there is some element that can be interacted with (clicked)

Then in each grain's scene, there a is a clear button with a label that lets the user know it can be clicked to return home
